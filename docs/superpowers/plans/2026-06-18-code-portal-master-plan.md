# CODE Portal — Master Design & Build Plan

> **Status:** v4 — AGREED, ready to implement. Claude ⇄ Codex converged over 4 adversarial rounds (needs-rework → ready-with-changes → ready-with-changes → **ready**). No implementation has begun; each Phase becomes its own task plan.
> **For agentic workers:** Each Phase below becomes its own `superpowers:writing-plans` bite-sized task plan at implementation time. This document is the architecture contract those plans must honor.
> **Revision log + review resolutions are at the end (§14).**

**Goal:** Build the full Ateneo CODE web application — a public OD publishing site plus a signed-in member portal and scoped admin tools — on Cloudflare (Workers via OpenNext, D1, R2) with Drizzle as the single schema/migration source of truth across local, shared-dev, and production.

**Architecture:** Next.js 16 App Router rendered on Cloudflare Workers through `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. All infrastructure access stays behind the existing adapter seam (`src/db`, `src/storage`, `src/server`). Drizzle ORM runs server-side in the prod Worker and the dev Worker against their own D1 bindings; pure-local fallback uses better-sqlite3 through the same Drizzle schema; outside ("shared") developers run the app locally and reach the **dev Worker** through a typed, per-domain internal API, authenticated by a bearer token that maps to a seeded actor — they never receive Cloudflare credentials.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 + local shadcn-style components, Drizzle ORM + drizzle-kit, Cloudflare D1 / R2 / Workers, OpenNext, Auth.js v5 (`next-auth`) + `@auth/drizzle-adapter` (Google OAuth, database sessions), Zod, Vitest + `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, shadcn/ui (local `src/components/ui` registry) + lucide-react.

## Global Constraints

- Public site is reader-first at `/`; member workspace lives under `/portal`; admin is a module inside the signed-in workspace, not a separate top-level brand.
- Drizzle schema at `src/db/schema.ts` is the ONE source of truth for all environments. One migration set under `drizzle/migrations`. No second hand-written migration tree.
- Only infrastructure/adapter code (`src/server/cloudflare.ts`, `src/db/adapters/*`, `src/storage/adapters/*`, internal-API route modules) may call `getCloudflareContext()` or touch raw bindings. Feature code uses repositories. System route handlers (e.g. `/l/[slug]`) may use `runInBackground()` — a thin `ctx.waitUntil` wrapper exported from `src/server/cloudflare.ts` — without otherwise touching bindings.
- Outside (shared-dev) developers must never receive production OR dev Cloudflare credentials. Shared mode talks to a typed internal API over HTTPS with a bearer token that maps to a seeded actor. No raw SQL endpoint. No generic "run any op" dispatcher. D1 is never exposed as `DATABASE_URL`.
- Two orthogonal axes (see §2): `DEPLOY_ENV` (`prod` | `dev`) identifies the deployed Worker + its bindings; `APP_ENV` (`local` | `shared` | `production`) identifies how a running process accesses data. The dev Worker runs `DEPLOY_ENV=dev` with `APP_ENV=production` (uses its own dev D1/R2 bindings) and additionally exposes the internal API.
- `STORAGE_MODE` values usable outside prod: `local`, `api`, `r2-s3`; prod is locked to `binding` unless `ALLOW_PRODUCTION_STORAGE_MODE_OVERRIDE=true`.
- Auth: Google OAuth only for v1, restricted to allowed Google Workspace domain(s) + an explicit allowlist for org Gmail accounts. First valid sign-in provisions a `members` row with the base `member` role; elevated roles are admin-assigned.
- Every mutation and every admin read is authorization-checked server-side via the SAME `permissions.can()` regardless of access mode. Every admin state change writes an audit log row.
- Mutating `/api/*` handlers (cookie-authenticated, same-origin) call `assertSameOrigin(request)`. `/internal/*` handlers are cross-origin by design: they authenticate with the shared bearer token, are guarded by `DEPLOY_ENV === 'dev'` (return 404 otherwise), use NO cookie auth, and apply a CORS allowlist instead of same-origin.
- All repository queries must respect the D1 budget (§3.4): batch within 100 bound params / 100 KB / statement, paginate unbounded lists, and have a backing index.
- No realtime infra in v1. Live-looking features use request/response + light client polling behind a data interface a Durable-Object layer can replace later.
- **Styling is Tailwind CSS v4** (already configured: `@tailwindcss/postcss`, tokens in `src/app/globals.css`). Style with Tailwind utility classes bound to the design tokens; no CSS-in-JS and no ad-hoc global CSS beyond `globals.css`. shadcn/ui components are themed through these same Tailwind tokens.
- **UI is built from shadcn/ui components** wherever one fits. The repo already has a shadcn-style local registry (`src/components/ui` + `components.json`); add/generate the official component with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>` (button, dialog, dropdown-menu, form, table, tabs, sheet, calendar, etc.) and theme it via the design tokens in `src/app/globals.css` rather than hand-rolling controls. Only write a bespoke component when shadcn has no equivalent, and build it on the same Radix/Tailwind primitives. Reuse before adding; do not duplicate an existing `ui/` component.
- Brand: headings Unna, body Source Sans; palette navy `#06192F`, white, blue `#0C315C`, light blue `#D7DFE9`, ink `#121315`, pale blue `#90B4CC`, plus supporting grays. No logo manipulation. No em dashes in UI copy, code comments, docs, commits. Plain product language; no AI-stock phrasing. Cards stay shallow (no cards inside cards). Light + dark themes (tokens already in the design export).

---

## 1. Product Scope & Route Map

### Public (unauthenticated)
- `/` landing; `/articles` index; `/articles/[slug]` detail (only `confidentiality = public`); `/services`; `/about` (or folded into `/`); `/contact`; `/signin` (low-emphasis Google entry).

### Member portal (authenticated, `/portal`, URL-addressable modules)
- `/portal` Overview, `/portal/profile`, `/portal/library`, `/portal/library/[slug]`, `/portal/links`, `/portal/events`, `/portal/events/[id]`, `/portal/calendar`, `/portal/announcements`, `/portal/surveys/[id]`.

### Admin (authenticated + scoped, `/portal/admin`)
- dashboard, `roles`, `events` (approvals), `links` (moderation), `publishing`, `surveys`, `audit`, `members`, `tour-settings`.

### System routes
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` (Auth.js: `/api/auth/signin/google`, `/api/auth/callback/google`, `/api/auth/signout`, session + csrf).
- `/l/[slug]` — short-link redirect + click capture. **Decision:** prefix route `/l/` (not bare root) so slugs do not compete with app routes and the reserved-slug surface stays small. Slugs are stored WITHOUT a leading slash (legacy `'/yhk'` row normalized on migration); the `/l/` prefix is purely a routing concern.
- `/api/uploads`, `/api/uploads/[key]` — object storage, auth-gated, server-assigned keys (§7).
- `/internal/<domain>/...` — typed shared-dev API modules (bearer-guarded, served by the dev Worker) (§3.3).
- `/api/health` — keep.

---

## 2. Environments & Infrastructure

### 2.1 Two axes (resolves the prior "shared mode is muddled" defect)
- **`DEPLOY_ENV`** ∈ `{prod, dev}` — which deployed Worker this is and which bindings it owns. `prod` → `code-nest` + `code-nest-prod-db` + `code-nest-prod-uploads`. `dev` → `code-nest-dev` + `code-nest-dev-db` + `code-nest-dev-uploads`.
- **`APP_ENV`** ∈ `{local, shared, production}` — how THIS process reads/writes data:
  - `production` → Drizzle on the local D1/R2 bindings (used by BOTH the prod Worker and the dev Worker; the dev Worker is just `DEPLOY_ENV=dev`).
  - `local` → Drizzle on better-sqlite3 (`LOCAL_SQLITE_PATH`) + filesystem/`r2-s3` storage. Core contributors with no Cloudflare access running plain `next dev`.
  - `shared` → no local DB; all data + storage calls proxy over HTTPS to the dev Worker's `/internal` API using `SHARED_API_TOKEN`. Outside developers.

| Process | DEPLOY_ENV | APP_ENV | DB | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prod Worker | prod | production | D1 binding `DB` | R2 binding `BUCKET` |
| Dev Worker | dev | production | dev D1 binding `DB` | dev R2 binding `BUCKET` |
| Core contributor (local) | — | local | better-sqlite3 | fs / r2-s3 |
| Outside dev (local) | — | shared | → dev Worker `/internal` | → dev Worker `/internal` or r2-s3 |

**Fix to apply:** `wrangler.jsonc` dev env currently sets `APP_ENV: "local"`; change it to `APP_ENV: "production"` and add `DEPLOY_ENV: "dev"` (prod sets `DEPLOY_ENV: "prod"`). Update `src/server/env.ts` + `src/db/index.ts` accordingly. The dev Worker thus uses its dev bindings directly AND hosts the internal API for shared clients.

### 2.2 Migrations
- `drizzle-kit generate` from `src/db/schema.ts` → `drizzle/migrations` (ONE set, applied everywhere). Apply to remote D1 via `db:migrate:dev|prod`.
- **Local better-sqlite3 path:** apply the SAME `drizzle/migrations` SQL to the `LOCAL_SQLITE_PATH` file with the `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3` migrator (new `db:migrate:local:sqlite` script). The current `local-sqlite.ts` hand-creating `users` is replaced by this migrator so local and D1 never diverge. (Contributors who prefer Wrangler local D1 still use `db:migrate:local --local`.)
- **Cleanup:** delete legacy `migrations/0001_code_portal_demo_schema.sql`; its demo data moves to the seed module (§9).
- **D1 FK choreography** (D1 enforces foreign keys by default): table rebuilds (notably `users`→`members`, §3.5) are RAW migration SQL applied by Wrangler — NOT runtime `batch()` code, and repositories never mutate schema. The rebuild migration's FIRST statement is `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys = ON;` (scoped to that migration file), followed by ordered parent-before-child inserts; drizzle-kit's generated SQLite table-recreate SQL is hand-reviewed for FK-safe ordering and tested against a copy of the remote D1 before prod.

### 2.3 Secrets / config (per env via `wrangler secret put` / `.dev.vars` / `.env.local`)
- `AUTH_SECRET` (Auth.js), `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`/`APP_BASE_URL` (per env), `trustHost: true` set in config.
- `AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`, `AUTH_ALLOWLIST_EMAILS` (consumed by the `signIn` callback).
- `SHARED_API_BASE_URL`, `SHARED_API_TOKEN` (already present). Each token maps to a seeded actor (§3.3).
- Extend `src/server/env.ts` Zod schema + conditional validation (OAuth keys required unless `APP_ENV=shared`; shared keys required when `APP_ENV=shared`; `DEPLOY_ENV` required on deployed Workers).

---

## 3. Data Access Layer

### 3.1 Problem
`local` and `production` differ only in the Drizzle driver. Replicating business logic per mode is wasteful; exposing a generic "run any op" RPC is unsafe. We want one logic layer + a safe, typed proxy for shared mode.

### 3.2 Design
1. **`getDb()`** in `src/db/client.ts`: returns `drizzle(better-sqlite3)` (APP_ENV=local) or `drizzle(env.DB)` (APP_ENV=production). Driver only.
2. **Repository layer** `src/db/repositories/*.ts` (one module per aggregate: `members`, `sessions`, `articles`, `library`, `links`, `events`, `points`, `surveys`, `announcements`, `notifications`, `calendar`, `audit`, `teams`). Pure async functions over the Drizzle handle. ALL query logic lives here, written once, used directly by the prod + dev Workers and local mode. **Every repository function takes an explicit `actor` (the resolved session member + roles) and calls `permissions.can()` before any privileged read/write, and `audit.record()` after privileged writes.** Authorization is in the repository/service layer so it holds identically across access modes.
3. **`getRepositories()`** in `src/db/index.ts`: returns the Drizzle-backed repositories for `local`/`production`, or the HTTP-backed implementation for `shared`.

### 3.3 Shared-dev internal API (resolves "no authz shape" + "no giant switch")
- **Per-domain typed modules**, not one dispatcher: `src/app/internal/<domain>/route.ts` (e.g. `members`, `library`, `links`, `events`, `surveys`, `announcements`, `audit`). Each operation is an explicit, named, Zod-validated endpoint.
- A shared contract `src/db/contract/*.ts` defines, per operation: input schema, output schema, `auth: 'public' | 'member' | 'admin'`, required `permission` (if any), and `sharedDev: 'allow' | 'deny'` (destructive/admin ops default `deny` in shared mode). The HTTP client and the route handlers are both generated/typed from this contract, so the transport stays DRY without a mega-switch.
- **Actor model for shared mode:** `SHARED_API_TOKEN` is a credential the dev Worker maps (via a `shared_dev_tokens` seed table or a config map) to a specific seeded `members` row + role set. The internal handler resolves that actor, then runs the SAME repository function with the SAME `permissions.can()` checks and audit writes as in-app. Outside devs can be issued different tokens to exercise member vs. admin paths. This keeps shared mode credential-free, authorization-faithful, and audited.
- **Transport security:** `/internal/*` does NOT use `assertSameOrigin` (cross-origin by design). Each handler (1) returns 404 unless `DEPLOY_ENV === 'dev'` so the routes are inert on the prod Worker even though Next deploys the code to both; (2) requires the shared bearer token and resolves it to a seeded actor via `shared_dev_tokens`; (3) uses no cookie auth; (4) applies a CORS allowlist. `src/server/env.ts` rejects any shared-dev token config when `DEPLOY_ENV='prod'`.
- **Storage over the proxy:** the existing `src/storage/adapters/shared-api.ts` expects `/internal/uploads`. Add it to the contract as a typed op with token→actor authz, server-assigned keys, content-type/size limits, and the same `DEPLOY_ENV='dev'` guard (mirrors §7).
- Destructive/admin ops require BOTH the actor's permission AND `sharedDev: 'allow'`.

### 3.4 D1 budget (binding acceptance criteria for every repo function)
- ≤ 100 bound parameters and ≤ 100 KB per SQL statement; chunk bulk writes (seed, fan-out) into batches that respect this.
- No unbounded `SELECT`; list endpoints paginate (cursor or limit/offset) with a sane default + max page size.
- Each query has a backing index (§6.x). Reviews reject a query with no index.
- Avoid per-request query storms; prefer set-based queries and `db.batch()` for multi-statement writes (single round trip, implicit transaction). No long-running transactions (D1 has no interactive transactions; use `batch()`).
- Keep per-request query count modest; treat large fan-outs as a smell (see notifications §6, calendar §6).

### 3.5 `users` → `members` reconciliation (inventory-first)
- **Phase 0 task, before writing the migration:** inventory the actual remote dev + prod D1 schemas (`wrangler d1 execute ... "SELECT name,sql FROM sqlite_master"`) to learn what is really deployed (Drizzle `0000` created only `users`; the legacy `migrations/0001` `members/resources/...` set may or may not have been applied).
- Pre-launch, with no real prod users, **recommended path: a clean reset of dev + prod D1** to the new schema, documented in `docs/operations/migrations.md`. If inventory shows real data, fall back to an additive migration: create `members`, backfill from `users`, keep a temporary compatibility view/route, then drop `users` in a later migration. Either way, port `/api/users` + its tests to `/api/members` (or retire them).
- Auth identity lives in the Auth.js `accounts` table (`provider='google'`); `members` is the Auth.js user. Additional providers are structurally supported by `accounts` but only Google is configured for v1.

---

## 4. Auth & Sessions

Auth is **Auth.js v5 (`next-auth`)** with the **`@auth/drizzle-adapter`** pointed at our `getDb()` Drizzle instance, so Auth.js's own tables live in OUR schema and migration set (no second source of truth, no raw `@auth/d1-adapter` tables to reconcile). Google is the only configured provider for v1; the `accounts` table makes additional providers structurally free later (deferred).

### 4.1 Configuration (`src/auth.ts`)
- **Lazy initialization (required on Workers):** use Auth.js lazy config — `export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth(async (req) => ({ adapter: DrizzleAdapter(getDb(), {...ourTables}), providers: [Google], session: { strategy: 'database' }, callbacks }))` — so the adapter and `getDb()` are constructed inside request/runtime context, never at import/build time. `getDb()` returns a lazy handle that calls `getCloudflareContext()` only on first use (avoids `next build`/static-analysis failures). Database sessions (not JWT) give revocable, server-stored sessions in the `sessions` table.
- App Router handlers: `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` → `export const { GET, POST } = handlers`. Sign-in/out via the exported `signIn`/`signOut`; `/signin` is a thin page calling `signIn('google')`.
- `AUTH_SECRET` set per env; `trustHost: true` (required behind the Worker proxy); `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` from env.

### 4.2 Domain gate + provisioning (takeover-safe by default)
- **`signIn` callback** rejects unless `account.provider==='google'` AND `profile.email_verified===true` AND (`profile.email` domain ∈ `AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` OR `profile.email` ∈ `AUTH_ALLOWLIST_EMAILS`). Optionally pass `hd` in `authorization.params` as a hint (not a security boundary; the callback is authoritative).
- **No `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking`** (Auth.js default false) → the round-1 email-takeover concern is handled by the library: a Google identity links only to an account already holding that exact provider account, never auto-merging by email.
- **Base membership is implicit, not a stored grant:** every `members` row with `status='active'` IS a base member; `member_roles` stores ONLY elevated scopes. This removes the failure mode where an Auth.js `events.createUser` side effect could leave a user with no base role. The `createUser` event is used only for an audit row + ensuring `status='active'`.
- **No pre-provisioning by email (v1):** with dangerous email-linking off, a real member row is created ONLY by that person's first Google sign-in. Admins do NOT create login-able member rows by email (that would collide with Auth.js `createUser` on first sign-in); admin member management edits already-signed-in members and assigns elevated roles. An invite/link flow is deferred. (Seeded dev members are demo data on dev/local only and are exercised in shared mode via `shared_dev_tokens`, not real Google sign-in.)

### 4.3 Members = Auth.js user, plus roles on the session
- Our `members` table IS the Auth.js `user` table, extended with CODE fields (§6). The adapter's required `accounts` + `sessions` + `verification_token` tables are defined in our Drizzle schema via the adapter's schema helpers. All CODE columns are nullable/defaulted so the adapter's `createUser` (which inserts only `id/name/email/email_verified/image`) succeeds.
- **`session` callback** attaches the member's resolved elevated roles to `session.user` (single query keyed by `member_roles.member_id`) so feature code reads `{ member, roles }` without re-querying. `auth()` is the single accessor used by layouts, server actions, and route handlers.

### 4.4 Where validation runs (resolves overstated middleware claim)
- **Phase 0 spike (required):** determine whether Auth.js's `auth()`/D1 works in Next middleware under OpenNext across (a) `next dev` with `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev()`, (b) `opennextjs-cloudflare preview`, (c) a deployed Worker. Record the result in `docs/architecture/auth.md`. (Auth.js database-session strategy needs DB access in middleware, which is the open question; JWT strategy would avoid it but loses easy revocation — we keep database sessions and validate in layouts unless the spike proves middleware-DB is safe.)
- Default: middleware does only a cheap session-cookie-presence redirect for `/portal/*`; authoritative `auth()` + role checks run in the `/portal` and `/portal/admin` layouts, server actions, and route handlers.

### 4.5 CSRF / hardening
- Auth.js provides built-in CSRF protection for its own routes. For our OWN mutating `/api/*` route handlers and server actions, enforce `assertSameOrigin(request)` (cookie-authenticated, same-origin); tested with a rejected cross-origin POST. `/internal/*` is exempt and uses bearer + `DEPLOY_ENV=dev` guard + CORS allowlist (§3.3).
- Rate-limit the auth routes, link creation, and scan submission (simple D1/KV counter or CF rule).

### 4.6 Shared mode and Auth.js
- Auth.js runs the real session flow in `local` (optional, needs Google creds), the dev Worker, and prod. In `shared` mode an outside dev has no Google creds and does not run Auth.js: the app uses a dev-session shim resolved from `SHARED_API_TOKEN` → seeded actor (§3.3), so identity + data both come from the token-mapped actor. `auth()` is wrapped by `getActor()` which returns the Auth.js session in real modes and the token-mapped actor in shared mode, giving feature code one uniform `{ member, roles }`. `getActor()` imports `auth()` lazily/dynamically so the Auth.js module + adapter are never loaded when `APP_ENV='shared'`.

---

## 5. Authorization (RBAC)

- Roles: `super`, `member`, `calendar`, `publishing`, `link`, `crs`, `member_admin` (seeded from the design's `ROLE_DEFS`). `super` inherits all scopes (resolved in code).
- `src/server/auth/permissions.ts`: `can(actor, action, resource?)` over a single action enum (`event:approve`, `points:assign`, `link:moderate`, `content:publish`, `role:assign`, `survey:configure`, `member:manage`, `library:read_confidential`, ...). Pure, exhaustively unit-tested.
- Enforced in repository/service functions (so it holds across access modes), admin layouts (gate by scope), and ownership checks (member edits only own link/list/comment unless holding the relevant admin scope). Confidential library access also checks team membership / ACL (§6).
- Every successful admin mutation → `audit.record(actor, action, targetType, targetId, detail, category)`.

---

## 6. Data Model (Drizzle, SQLite dialect)

One `schema.ts` (split into `schema/` re-exported if it grows). IDs are app-generated prefixed strings (`src/lib/ids.ts`). Timestamps are integer epoch-ms (`mode:"timestamp_ms"`) consistently. FK `references()` are declared (D1 enforces them) — migrations honor FK-safe ordering (§2.2). **Every table's indexes are listed; a query without a backing index fails review.** Drizzle TS property names are camelCase mapping to snake_case SQL columns; the Auth.js adapter relies on EXACT property names — `emailVerified` → column `email_verified`, `sessionToken` → `session_token`, `userId` → `user_id` — so those tables use the adapter's expected property names even though columns below are shown in SQL form.

**Identity & access** (Auth.js `@auth/drizzle-adapter` tables live here; `members` IS the Auth.js `user` table, extended)
- `members(id pk, email unique, email_verified timestamp_ms null, name null, image null, full_name null, nickname null, pronouns null, batch null, birthday null, birthday_private bool default true, avatar_key null, status['active'|'pending'|'inactive'] default 'active', tour_member_done bool default false, tour_admin_done bool default false, created_at, updated_at)` — idx: `email`, `status`. (`name`/`image`/`email_verified` are Auth.js fields; all CODE fields are nullable/defaulted so adapter `createUser` succeeds and profile is completed later.)
- `accounts(user_id fk→members.id, type, provider, provider_account_id, refresh_token null, access_token null, expires_at null, token_type null, scope null, id_token null, session_state null, pk(provider, provider_account_id))` — idx: `user_id`. Google identity (the old `google_sub` is now `provider='google' + provider_account_id`). No `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking`.
- `sessions(session_token pk, user_id fk→members.id, expires)` — Auth.js database-session table (replaces the prior custom hashed-token table) — idx: `user_id`.
- `verification_token(identifier, token, expires, pk(identifier, token))` — adapter-required even though OAuth-only.
- `roles(id pk, key unique, label, description, kind)`; `member_roles(member_id fk→members.id, role_id fk, assigned_by fk null, assigned_at, pk(member_id, role_id))` — idx: `role_id`.
- `shared_dev_tokens(token_hash pk, member_id fk, label, created_at)` — maps shared bearer tokens to seeded actors (dev Worker only; never seeded into prod).

**Consultancy teams (for confidential content ACL)**
- `consultancy_teams(id pk, name, created_at)`; `team_members(team_id fk, member_id fk, pk(...))` — idx: `member_id`.

**Content / publishing** (`articles` powers public Product Center + members Library; gated by `confidentiality` + ACL)
- `articles(id pk, slug unique, kind['article'|'case'], confidentiality['public'|'members'|'confidential'], category, title, dek, abstract, author, client null, read_time, locked bool, date_sort int, published_at null, created_by fk, created_at, updated_at)` — idx: `slug`, `confidentiality`, `published_at`, `date_sort`, `category`.
- `article_sections / article_components / article_questions / article_refs(id pk, article_id fk, position, ...)` — idx: `article_id`.
- `topics(id pk, name unique)`; `article_topics(article_id fk, topic_id fk, pk(...))` — idx: `topic_id`.
- `article_related(article_id fk, related_id fk, pk(...))`.
- `article_acl(article_id fk, principal_type['member'|'role'|'team'], principal_id, pk(article_id, principal_type, principal_id))` — confidential articles list their allowed principals; `library:read_confidential` (content admin) bypasses. idx: `article_id`.

**Library member state**
- `favorites(member_id fk, article_id fk, created_at, pk(...))` — idx: `article_id`.
- `lists(id pk, member_id fk, name, color, created_at)` — idx: `member_id`; `list_items(list_id fk, article_id fk, position, pk(list_id, article_id))`.
- `comments(id pk, article_id fk, member_id fk, parent_id fk null, body, created_at)` — idx: `(article_id, created_at)`, `parent_id`. One reply level.

**Short links**
- `short_links(id pk, slug unique, destination_url, title, owner_member_id fk, click_count int default 0, created_at, updated_at)` — idx: `slug`, `owner_member_id`. `destination_url` validated http/https only (open-redirect guard).
- `reserved_slugs(slug pk)` (seeded).
- **Analytics (rollup-primary, resolves D1 write-storm risk):** `link_daily_stats(link_id fk, date, referrer_bucket, device_bucket, count, pk(link_id, date, referrer_bucket, device_bucket))` is the source of truth for the 30-day series + referrer/device breakdowns the design shows. The `/l/[slug]` redirect resolves and 302s immediately, then records analytics (one upsert-increment into `link_daily_stats` + bump `short_links.click_count`) via `runInBackground()` (a `ctx.waitUntil` wrapper from `src/server/cloudflare.ts`) AFTER responding — analytics is fail-open and must never block or fail the redirect. Raw `link_events` are NOT stored in v1 (optional sampled+TTL later). idx: `(link_id, date)`.

**CRS events**
- `crs_events(id pk, title, type['official'|'casual'|'birthday'], status['pending'|'approved'|'rejected'], points null, place, capacity null, starts_at, ends_at null, description, created_by fk, approved_by fk null, approved_at null, checkin_secret, created_at)` — idx: `status`, `starts_at`, `type`, `created_by`.
- `event_rsvps(event_id fk, member_id fk, state['going'|'none'], updated_at, pk(...))` — idx: `member_id`.
- `crs_attendance(event_id fk, member_id fk, scanned_at, scanned_by fk, pk(event_id, member_id))` — idx: `member_id`.
- `event_media(id pk, event_id fk, r2_key, caption null, uploaded_by fk, created_at)` — idx: `event_id`.
- `event_forum_posts(id pk, event_id fk, member_id fk, anonymous bool, parent_id fk null, body, created_at)` — idx: `(event_id, created_at)`, `parent_id`. **Anonymity:** `member_id` is ALWAYS stored (for moderation); when `anonymous=true` the API never returns author identity to members or normal admins; only `super` may reveal via an audited action.

**Points / retention** (derived, not stored as truth)
- `terms(id pk, name, retained_at int, probation_below int, starts_at, ends_at)` — idx: `(starts_at, ends_at)`.
- `point_awards(id pk, member_id fk, term_id fk, event_id fk null, points, reason, awarded_by fk, awarded_at)` — idx: `(member_id, term_id)`, `term_id`. Retention status + leaderboard are query-derived; if profiling shows hot paths, add a cached `member_term_points` rollup later (not v1 truth).

**Surveys** (true anonymity via assignment token)
- `surveys(id pk, event_id fk null, title, status['draft'|'running'|'closed'], sample_size null, created_by fk, created_at)` — idx: `status`, `event_id`.
- `survey_questions(id pk, survey_id fk, position, type['scale'|'text'|'choice'], prompt, options_json null)` — idx: `survey_id`.
- `survey_assignments(survey_id fk, member_id fk, response_token_hash unique, assigned_at, completed_at null, pk(survey_id, member_id))` — idx: `member_id`, `response_token_hash`. Random sample writes selected members + a per-assignment opaque token (only its hash is stored).
- `survey_responses(id pk, survey_id fk, submitted_at)` + `survey_answers(id pk, response_id fk, question_id fk, value)`. **Responses carry ONLY `survey_id`** — no `member_id`, no assignment ref, no token — so there is NO join key from a response back to a member. Submit flow: client sends the raw token; server runs a conditional `UPDATE survey_assignments SET completed_at=now WHERE response_token_hash=? AND completed_at IS NULL` and proceeds ONLY if it affected exactly 1 row (enforces one-submit + valid token), then inserts the anonymous `survey_responses`/`survey_answers` via `db.batch()`. (A crash between the update and the insert leaves an assignment marked complete with no response — a rare, acceptable lost slot; documented.)

**Announcements / notifications** (hybrid: derive where possible, materialize only per-member events)
- `announcements(id pk, title, body, tag null, audience_kind['all'|'role'|'batch'], audience_value null, pinned_until null, scheduled_for null, published_at null, author_member_id fk, created_at)` — idx: `published_at`, `(audience_kind, audience_value)`, `pinned_until`.
- `member_feed_state(member_id pk, announcements_seen_at, surveys_seen_at, events_seen_at)` — cheap per-member cursor for deriving unread counts (announcements, survey assignments, newly available events) WITHOUT fanning out a row per member per item.
- `notifications(id pk, member_id fk, kind, title, body, href null, read_at null, created_at)` — idx: `(member_id, read_at, created_at)`. **Only materialized for genuinely per-member events** (comment reply to you, your attendance confirmed, points awarded to you, your link milestone). Announcement/survey/event-availability "notifications" are DERIVED from `announcements` + `survey_assignments` + `member_feed_state` at read time, not fanned out.

**Audit**
- `audit_logs(id pk, actor_member_id fk, actor_context['session'|'shared_dev_token'] default 'session', shared_token_hash null, shared_token_label null, action, target_type, target_id, detail null, category['role'|'event'|'content'|'survey'|'link'|'member'], created_at)` — idx: `(category, created_at)`, `actor_member_id`. In shared mode the token-mapped actor is recorded as `actor_member_id` with `actor_context='shared_dev_token'` plus the token label, so attribution between two devs sharing one seeded actor is never ambiguous.

**Calendar — derived, with an explicit contract**
- No table. `calendar.getMonth(actor, range)`: union of approved `crs_events` whose audience the actor can see, members' birthdays where `birthday_private=false` OR actor has `member:manage`, term deadlines, and published announcements matching the actor's audience. Bounded date window (single month/agenda page); each source query indexed and date-bounded. Birthday privacy + announcement audience are enforced in the contract.

---

## 7. Storage (R2) — hardened in Phase 1 (resolves wide-open upload defect)

- Uses the existing `StorageAdapter` (binding / r2-s3 / local-fs / shared-api).
- **`/api/uploads` (POST):** require an authenticated session; the SERVER assigns the key from a fixed namespace based on purpose + actor (`avatars/{memberId}`, `events/{eventId}/{mediaId}`); the client may NOT supply `key`/`x-object-key`. Validate content-type against an allowlist (images) and enforce a max size. Authorize the namespace (e.g., event media requires the member can post to that event).
- **`/api/uploads/[key]` (GET):** authorize by namespace (event media = members; avatars = members). **DELETE:** require session + ownership/admin; remove the current unauthenticated DELETE entirely.
- QR codes generated client-side on demand (light/dark/transparent/logo); persisting to R2 deferred (YAGNI v1).

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

- **Phase 0 adds deps + scripts:** `next-auth@5`, `@auth/drizzle-adapter`, `vitest`, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, `@vitest/...`; `"test"`, `"test:watch"`, `"db:migrate:local:sqlite"` scripts. (`better-sqlite3`, `zod`, `drizzle-kit` already present.)
- **Unit (Vitest, node):** `permissions.can()` matrix; slug + reserved-slug + destination-URL validation; point/retention computation; survey seeded-RNG sampling (deterministic); session hashing; audience resolution; calendar assembly; `assertSameOrigin`.
- **Integration (`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`):** repositories against an ephemeral D1 with `drizzle/migrations` applied in `beforeAll`; route handlers — auth callback (mocked Google token endpoint, including the takeover-fallback guard), `/l/[slug]` redirect + daily-stat upsert, RSVP, check-in scan (anti-replay), publish gating, confidential-ACL gating, upload authz (rejects caller key, rejects unauth GET/DELETE), cross-origin POST rejection.
- **Shared-mode parity test:** for representative ops, assert the Drizzle path and the `/internal` proxy path return equal results AND enforce the same authz (a `sharedDev:'deny'` op is refused over the proxy).
- **Migration test:** `drizzle-kit generate` is clean (no uncommitted drift); the `users→members` migration applies on a seeded copy with FK deferral.
- **E2E (Playwright, light, Phase 10):** sign-in (mocked OAuth), create link, RSVP + simulated scan, publish article, assign role.
- **CI gates:** `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, clean `drizzle-kit generate`, `pnpm build` (OpenNext).

---

## 9. Seeding

- `src/db/seed/data.ts` from the design files (`design/data.jsx`, `member-*-data.jsx`, `admin-data.jsx`): members, roles, teams, public + members + confidential articles (sections/components/questions/refs/topics/related/acl), short links + reserved slugs + seeded `link_daily_stats`, CRS events (upcoming + past) + forum posts + attendance, point awards + a term, one running survey + assignments, announcements, audit samples, and (dev only) `shared_dev_tokens`.
- `src/db/seed/run.ts` idempotent (insert-or-ignore by id), batched within the D1 budget. Scripts `db:seed:local`, `db:seed:dev`. Never runs against prod.

---

## 10. Security Considerations

- Sessions: Auth.js database sessions (`sessions` table), httpOnly/Secure cookie, revocable; sign-out deletes the row. `AUTH_SECRET` per env; `trustHost: true`.
- Server-side authz in repositories on every mutation + admin read; ownership + team/ACL checks.
- Uploads: auth + server-assigned keys + content-type/size limits + authorized GET/DELETE.
- Auth.js CSRF for auth routes; `assertSameOrigin` on our own mutating `/api/*` handlers + server actions; rate limits on auth/link-create/scan.
- Short-link destination validation (http/https) to block open-redirect abuse.
- Shared API: bearer token → seeded actor; per-op `auth`/`permission`/`sharedDev` gating; no raw SQL; rotation documented; destructive ops denied in shared mode.
- No secrets client-side; bindings confined to adapters/internal modules.
- PII (emails, birthdays) members-only; never on public routes; birthday privacy honored in calendar.

---

## 11. Explicitly Deferred (recorded so they resurface)

1. **Graph / semantic library search** (the library "graph search" path). Candidates: Cloudflare Vectorize + Workers AI embeddings over the corpus, or a graphify-style knowledge graph traversing `article_related` + `topics` (both already in the model). *(Saved to project memory.)*
2. **Realtime** live check-in feed + forum via Durable Objects + WebSockets (v1 polls behind the same data interface).
3. **Email** (Cloudflare Email Service) for announcement digests / alternative auth.
4. **Additional auth providers** (the `accounts` table already supports them; only Google is wired for v1).
5. **Advanced link analytics** (raw event sampling, geo, bot filtering, UTM).

---

## 12. Phased Build Sequence

Bottom-up; each phase ends with working, tested software and gets its own task plan.

- **Phase 0 — Foundations + spikes:** add deps/scripts/test harness; **middleware-D1 spike** (§4.3); **D1 schema inventory** of remote dev/prod (§3.5); finalize `schema.ts` (all tables + indexes); generate migration; delete legacy `migrations/`; `users→members` reset/migration with FK choreography; `DEPLOY_ENV`/`APP_ENV` split in `wrangler.jsonc` + `env.ts` + `db/index.ts`; `getDb()` + repository skeletons + contract; seed module; **shared-Worker lifecycle docs in AGENTS.md / README.md / CLAUDE.md / docs (§15)**. *Acceptance:* migrations apply local+dev; seed loads within budget; repo + shared-parity tests green; spike documented; redeploy obligations written into AGENTS/README/CLAUDE; shared-dev deploy CI/PR guard in place (§15).
- **Phase 1 — Auth, RBAC, Upload hardening:** Auth.js Google flow (`@auth/drizzle-adapter`, DB sessions) + `signIn`-callback domain gate + base-role provisioning; `getActor()` unifying real + shared-mode actors; `permissions.can()`; `/portal` layout gate; profile; sign-out; **harden `/api/uploads` + `/api/uploads/[key]` now** (before any feature uses R2). *Acceptance:* domain-restricted sign-in; role-gated test route; permission matrix tested; uploads reject caller keys + unauth GET/DELETE.
- **Phase 2 — Public site:** DB-backed landing, `/articles` + `/articles/[slug]` (public only), services/projects, contact, `/signin`. *Acceptance:* renders from D1 seed; confidential content never leaks to public routes (tested).
- **Phase 3 — Portal shell + Overview + Notifications:** authed shell, URL-addressable modules, overview, notifications (materialized + derived).
- **Phase 4 — Library:** list/detail, filters/topics, favorites, lists, threaded comments, confidentiality + team/ACL gating.
- **Phase 5 — Short links:** CRUD + ownership, reserved/format/destination validation, `/l/[slug]` redirect + daily-stat upsert, analytics views, QR export, admin moderation.
- **Phase 6 — CRS events:** create→approve, RSVP, QR check-in (anti-replay via rotating `checkin_secret` + signed time-boxed token; scan validated server-side, idempotent), attendance, media (R2), forum (anonymity rules), point awards + retention + leaderboard.
- **Phase 7 — Surveys:** create, random sample + tokens, anonymous response flow, admin results (identity-free).
- **Phase 8 — Calendar + Announcements:** derived calendar with the §6 contract, announcement CRUD (pin/schedule/audience), notification derive+materialize on publish/approve/assign/reply.
- **Phase 9 — Admin + Audit:** roles management (super inheritance), scoped queues (CRS approvals, link moderation, publishing), audit view + filters, dashboard metrics, member management, guided tours (replayable).
- **Phase 10 — Hardening:** rate limits, security review, Playwright E2E, OpenNext caching pass (§13), docs refresh, shared-dev onboarding verification.

---

## 13. Caching (OpenNext) — note

`open-next.config.ts` already exists (minimal defaults). Decisions: everything under `/portal/*` is dynamic (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` or per-request `cookies()` access forcing dynamic). Public article pages render SSR for v1 (DB-backed, no ISR) to keep publishing changes instant; revisit ISR + `revalidateTag` only if read load demands it (would require enabling an incremental cache override in `open-next.config.ts`). The short-link redirect is dynamic.

## 14. Revision Log & Review Resolutions

**v2 (after Codex adversarial round 1 — verdict was needs-rework):**

| # | Finding (sev) | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Shared mode muddled (blocker) | §2.1 split `DEPLOY_ENV` vs `APP_ENV`; dev Worker = `DEPLOY_ENV=dev, APP_ENV=production` + hosts internal API; fix `wrangler.jsonc`. |
| 2 | RPC no authz shape (blocker) | §3.2–3.3 authz moved into repositories with explicit `actor`; contract declares `auth`/`permission`/`sharedDev`; token→seeded-actor; audit coupled. |
| 3 | Uploads wide open (blocker) | §7 + Phase 1: server-assigned keys, auth, content-type/size limits, authorized GET, remove unauth DELETE — done before any R2 feature. |
| 4 | Middleware claim overstated (major) | §4.3 added a Phase 0 spike across dev/preview/deployed; default to layout validation pending proof. |
| 5 | D1 enforces FKs (major) | §2.2 FK choreography with `defer_foreign_keys` + ordered backfill + tested on remote copy. |
| 6 | D1 limit budgeting absent (major) | §3.4 explicit budget as repo acceptance criteria. |
| 7 | Missing indexes (major) | §6 every table lists indexes; no-index query fails review. |
| 8 | Link analytics not v1-safe (major) | §6 `link_daily_stats` rollup is source of truth; no per-click rows in v1. |
| 9 | Session crypto under-specified (major) | §4.2 opaque random token + `sha256` (no secret); `OAUTH_STATE_SECRET` only for OAuth-state HMAC. |
| 10 | CSRF incomplete (major) | §4.4 `assertSameOrigin` on all mutating `/api/*` + `/internal/*` + tests. |
| 11 | OAuth email-fallback takeover (major) | §4.1 fallback only when `google_sub IS NULL` + active + allowed verified email + audit. |
| 12 | users→members hand-waved (major) | §3.5 inventory-first; recommend clean reset pre-launch, additive+backfill otherwise. |
| 13 | Confidentiality ACL missing (major) | §6 `consultancy_teams` + `team_members` + `article_acl` + `library:read_confidential`. |
| 14 | Anonymity not real (major) | §6 surveys store `response_token` not member; forum stores member but hides identity (super-only reveal). |
| 15 | Notifications over-scoped (major) | §6 hybrid: derive announcement/survey/availability via `member_feed_state`; materialize only per-member events. |
| 16 | One giant RPC switch (major) | §3.3 per-domain typed modules under `src/app/internal/<domain>`, not a dispatcher. |
| 17 | Deps don't match plan (minor) | §8 + Phase 0 add arctic/vitest/pool-workers + test script. |
| 18 | OpenNext caching underspecified (minor) | §13 added; **note: `open-next.config.ts` already exists** (Codex said it did not). |
| 19 | Slug contradicts data (minor) | §1 slugs stored without leading slash; `/l/` is routing-only; legacy `'/yhk'` normalized. |
| 20 | — | Verdict tracked; aiming for ready-with-changes next round. |

**v3 (after Codex adversarial round 2 — verdict was ready-with-changes; both round-1 pushbacks confirmed):**

| # | Finding (sev) | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `/internal/*` CSRF rule contradicts shared-dev (blocker) | Global Constraints + §3.3 + §4.5: `/api/*` uses `assertSameOrigin`; `/internal/*` is cross-origin (bearer + `DEPLOY_ENV=dev` 404 guard + CORS allowlist, no cookie auth). |
| 2 | Prod still ships `/internal/*` code (major) | §3.3: every `/internal/*` returns 404 unless `DEPLOY_ENV==='dev'`; `env.ts` rejects shared-dev config on prod. |
| 3 | Token→actor audit ambiguity (major) | §6 `audit_logs` adds `actor_context` + `shared_token_hash` + `shared_token_label`. |
| 4 | Survey join key defeats anonymity (major) | §6: token-hash only on `survey_assignments`; `survey_responses` carry only `survey_id`; conditional-update gate for one-submit. |
| 5 | Local better-sqlite has no migration runner (major) | §2.2: `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3` migrator over the same `drizzle/migrations`; new `db:migrate:local:sqlite`; retire hand-created `users`. |
| 6 | Internal storage proxy missing (major) | §3.3: add `/internal/uploads` to the contract (token→actor authz, server keys, limits, dev guard). |
| 7 | FK choreography too vague (major) | §2.2: raw Wrangler migration SQL with `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys=ON` first; not runtime `batch()`; tested on remote copy. |
| 8 | Redirect blocked by stats write (minor) | §6: `/l/[slug]` 302s first, records stats via `ctx.waitUntil`, fail-open. |
| 9 | `member_feed_state` can't track events (minor) | §6: add `events_seen_at`. |
| — | User decision: **Auth.js** for auth | §4 fully rewritten to Auth.js v5 + `@auth/drizzle-adapter` (DB sessions, Google), replacing the Arctic + custom-session design. Email-takeover concern now covered by Auth.js defaults (no dangerous email linking). |
| — | User question: shared dev Worker ops | New §15 added (shared Worker lifecycle + when to redeploy + AGENTS/README/CLAUDE doc deliverable). |
| — | User directive: use shadcn/ui | Global Constraints now require building UI from the shadcn/ui local registry (`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add …`) wherever one fits; bespoke only when no shadcn equivalent. Applies to every UI phase (2-9). |
| — | User directive: use Tailwind CSS | Global Constraints now require Tailwind CSS v4 (already configured) for all styling, bound to `globals.css` tokens; no CSS-in-JS / ad-hoc global CSS. Applies to every UI phase. |

**Phase 0 review (Codex implementation, accepted with follow-ups):** foundations green (typecheck/lint/test/migrate/seed). Follow-ups folded into the Phase 1 handoff: (1) wire `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` D1 harness; (2) add a members repo D1 integration test + a shared-mode parity test; (3) implement the `/internal/*` per-domain routes the §3.3 contract describes.

**v4 (after Codex adversarial round 3 — verdict ready-with-changes; round-2 fixes confirmed correct):**

| # | Finding (sev) | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Adapter eagerly touches bindings (major) | §4.1 lazy `NextAuth(async req => …)` + lazy `getDb()`; `getActor()` dynamically imports `auth()` (§4.6). |
| 2 | Extended members breaks adapter (major) | §6 all CODE columns nullable/defaulted; `email_verified` timestamp_ms; adapter `createUser` inserts only auth fields. |
| 3 | Base role via event fragile (major) | §4.2/§5 base `member` is implicit; `member_roles` stores only elevated scopes. |
| 4 | No-email-linking vs pre-created members (major) | §4.2 v1 members self-provision on first sign-in; admins never create login rows by email; invite flow deferred. |
| 5 | Stale auth route map (minor) | §1 now `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`. |
| 6 | `ctx.waitUntil` vs adapters-only rule (minor) | Global Constraints + §6 add `runInBackground()` helper from `src/server/cloudflare.ts`. |
| 7 | §15 triggers miss auth/env/runtime (minor) | §15 adds triggers 6-8 (auth.ts, env.ts, wrangler.jsonc, storage proxy, deps). |
| 8 | Docs-only shared guard weak (minor) | §15 moves a CI/PR guard into Phase 0. |

**Open for round 4 (convergence pass):** with all blockers/majors resolved across 3 rounds, confirm whether the plan is now **ready**. Remaining genuinely-open items are deliberately pushed to implementation spikes, not plan gaps: (a) the middleware-vs-D1 result (Phase 0 spike); (b) clean-reset vs additive `users→members` (decided by the Phase 0 D1 inventory). Flag anything still blocking implementation.

## 15. Shared Dev Worker Lifecycle & Ops Docs

The `shared` access mode is backed by the **deployed dev Worker** (`code-nest-dev`, `DEPLOY_ENV=dev`), which owns `code-nest-dev-db` + `code-nest-dev-uploads` and hosts the `/internal/*` API. Outside developers run the app locally with `APP_ENV=shared` and depend on that Worker being current. This creates explicit redeploy obligations.

**When the dev Worker MUST be redeployed (and dev D1 migrated/seeded):**
1. Any change to `src/db/schema.ts` / `drizzle/migrations` → run `db:migrate:dev` then `deploy:dev`. Stale schema breaks every shared client.
2. Any change to the internal API contract (`src/db/contract/*`, `src/app/internal/*`) or repository signatures used over the proxy → `deploy:dev`.
3. Any change to `permissions.ts`, the shared `actor` resolution, or `shared_dev_tokens` mapping → `deploy:dev` (+ reseed dev tokens if changed).
4. Seed/demo-data changes outside devs rely on → `db:seed:dev`.
5. Auth.js config changes that affect the dev Worker's own sign-in (real OAuth on dev) → `deploy:dev` + ensure dev secrets set.
6. Changes to `src/auth.ts`, `src/server/env.ts`, or `wrangler.jsonc` env/bindings → `deploy:dev` (+ set/rotate dev secrets as needed).
7. Changes to the storage proxy (`/internal/uploads`, `src/storage/adapters/shared-api.ts`) → `deploy:dev`.
8. Dependency/runtime upgrades affecting the dev Worker (Auth.js, drizzle adapter, OpenNext) → `deploy:dev`.

**Token + secret ops:** rotating `SHARED_API_TOKEN` requires updating the dev Worker secret (`wrangler secret put`), updating the `shared_dev_tokens` seed, and reissuing `.env.local` to outside devs. Documented in `docs/operations/secrets-and-env.md`.

**Documentation deliverable (Phase 0 + ongoing):** capture the above in:
- `AGENTS.md` — a "Shared dev Worker" section: what it is, and the redeploy/migrate triggers list above, so any agent that touches schema/contract/permissions knows to `db:migrate:dev` + `deploy:dev`.
- `README.md` — a short "Shared dev backend" subsection pointing at the dev Worker and the redeploy rule, plus the `APP_ENV=shared` onboarding pointer.
- `CLAUDE.md` (create a project-level one) — a concise rule: "After changing schema, migrations, the internal contract, permissions, or auth config, redeploy the dev Worker (`db:migrate:dev` + `deploy:dev`) or shared-mode developers break."
- **Phase 0 CI/PR guard:** a lightweight check that flags when `src/db/schema.ts`, `drizzle/migrations/**`, `src/db/contract/**`, `src/app/internal/**`, `src/server/auth/permissions.ts`, or `src/auth.ts` change without a shared-dev deploy note — docs alone are the kind of rule agents miss, so this is automated rather than left to Phase 10.
- `docs/setup/shared-dev-onboarding.md` + `docs/operations/migrations.md` — expand with the lifecycle + token rotation.

> Note: these doc edits are part of the build (Phase 0 deliverable), not done in this planning pass. They are listed here so the obligation is explicit and reviewable.
